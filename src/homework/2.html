			<h1>The Effect of Contactless Payment on Compulsice Spending</h1>
			<p>
					For a very long time, the only way to buy something was with cold hard cash. 
				Fast-forward to the present day and youâ€™ll find that people buy things through the tap 
				of their phone or the swipe of their cards. Over a relatively short period, money evolved 
				and transformed to make transactions easier and more secure. We've gone from cash to credit/debit
				cards to virtual forms of those cards. Each of these advancements has not only made purchases 
				easier but has made them faster. I believe that the efficiency of contactless payment has had 
				a massive effect on compulsive spending.
