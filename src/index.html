			<h1>The Effect of Contactless Payment on Compulsice Spending</h1>
			<p>
				For a very long time, the only way to buy something was with cold hard cash.<br>
				Fast-forward to the present day and you’ll find that people buy things through the tap<br>
				of their phone or the swipe of their cards. Over a relatively short period, money evolved<br>
				and transformed to make transactions easier and more secure. We've gone from cash to credit/debit<br>
				cards to virtual forms of those cards. Each of these advancements has not only made purchases<br>
				easier but has made them faster. I believe that the efficiency of contactless payment has had<br> 
				a massive effect on compulsive spending.<br>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<h2>Looking at the invention and evolution of “alternate money” will reveal how compulsive spending has developed.<br></h2>
				I believe compulsive spending began to form with the invention of the credit card<br> 
				in the 1950s. Before credit cards, everyday spending was limited by the amount of money in one’s wallet.<br> 
				Credit cards allowed for the increase in size or quantity of purchases because it was essentially<br> 
				“unlimited” money. One of the big downsides to credit cards is the interest which I believe swayed<br> 
				people from making compulsive purchases. This problem was later eliminated with the invention of debit<br> 
				cards in the 1960s which I believe caused a massive increase in compulsory purchases. People were able<br> 
				to buy things with the swipe of a card without worrying about paying more with interest later. Things<br> 
				didn’t stop here though, contactless payment or “tap to buy” which was invented in the 1990s, made<br> 
				transactions even easier. Using contactless payment not only removed the need to insert your card but<br> 
				also removed the need to insert your pin. This feature would later be incorporated into smartphones<br> 
				which allowed for the storage of one's credit/debit card on the phone. People no longer even needed to<br> 
				carry around their wallets anymore because their cards can be used directly from their phones. The<br> 
				invention of contactless payment increased compulsive spending by making it easier to access greater<br> 
				amounts of money.<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				<h3>Another reason contactless payment increases compulsive spending is the reduced speed it takes to buy things.</h3><br>
				The quicker one can buy something, the less time one will spend thinking about the purchase. When people<br>
				were limited by the amount of money in their wallets, they had to spend a decent amount of time contemplating<br>
				if they wanted to buy that thing because they would have to go to the bank if they needed more money.<br> 
				Paying with cash is also a slow process which would add to the amount of time a person spends thinking<br>
				about a purchase. After the creation of debit and credit cards, purchases only became slightly faster,<br> 
				but after the creation of contactless payment, purchases became a lot quicker. The elimination of certain<br> 
				steps in the purchasing process allowed for transactions within a couple of seconds. Nowadays, if someone<br> 
				wants something, they barely think and quickly buy. This decreased amount of time to purchase something<br> 
				leaves less room for doubt or regret and ultimately makes people compulsive buyers.<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				In conclusion, ever since people stopped paying for things with cash, there has been an increase in<br>
				compulsive purchases. The invention of credit/debit cards and eventually contactless payment has made<br>
				buying things faster and easier. Because contactless payment drastically reduces the amount of time it<br> 
				takes to make a purchase, there is less time for that person to change their mind. One thing I think<br> 
				is interesting is what the future holds for this technology. What could be the next step for contactless<br> 
				payment? Will a new means of purchase arise? And most importantly, what effects might it have on society?<br>

				Addendum

			<ul>
				<li>I choose the custom that I used for homework 3</li>
				<li>This font was used for header 1, 2, and 3</li>
				<li>This made it so the headers got smaller as the text progresses</li>
				<li>I was unable to link the styles file so I just copied it to the page</li>
